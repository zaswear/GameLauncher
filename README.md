# üöÄ What To Play?

A multi-tool web application designed for gamers to discover new games and make decisions. Built with vanilla JavaScript, Vercel Serverless Functions, and the RAWG.io API.

This project is a portal that hosts three distinct, powerful tools for gamers.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† 1. Game-Match
* **Concept**: A recommendation engine that acts like a "game sommelier".
* **Functionality**: Users input up to three of their favorite games. The backend analyzes the genres and tags of these games to create a unique "taste profile" and then recommends a new, highly-rated game that matches this profile.

### ‚è≥ 2. Gaming Time Machine
* **Concept**: A nostalgic journey through the history of gaming.
* **Functionality**: Users can select any year from a dropdown menu. The application then fetches and displays the top-rated games released in that specific year, offering a "time capsule" of what was great back then.

### üéÆ 3. Co-op Decider
* **Concept**: A simple tool to solve the age-old problem of "what should we play tonight?".
* **Functionality**: A group of friends selects the gaming platforms they all have in common (e.g., PC and PlayStation). The tool then finds a random, highly-rated co-op or multiplayer game available on all selected platforms and presents it as the "Oracle's choice".

### ‚úâÔ∏è Contact Form
* A secure, backend-powered contact form that allows users to send an email without exposing the recipient's address.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ESM)
* **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
* **API**: [RAWG.io API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
* **Email**: [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) (for the contact form)
* **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
